/*
Given: 
- two strings, s and t

Task: 
- Return true if t is an anagram of s, false otherwise

Constraints;
- s and t are always lowercase

Idea: 
- Can compare every element and make sure they're all the same
- Add all the values of one word to a map, and check that every other letter in the other 
is in the map. Also validate the length to make sure they're the same.
